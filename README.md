# RPSSL — Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard (Console Version)

This project is a console-based implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard (RPSSL), created as part of programming activities (Activities 23–33).  
The program runs entirely in the terminal and does not require any GUI.  

## Project Description

The game extends the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors with two extra shapes: Spock and Lizard.  
The goal is to reach a specified winning score before the computer (the agent) does.

The program:
- Lets the user choose between five shapes.  
- Lets the computer randomly choose a shape.  
- Determines who wins each round and updates the score.  
- Continues until one player reaches the WinningScore (default = 3).  
- Displays the final result and announces the winner.
