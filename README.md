# RPSSL — Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard (Console Version)

This project is a **console-based implementation** of *Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard (RPSSL)*, created as part of programming activities (Activities 23–33).  
The program runs entirely in the **terminal** and does not require any GUI.  
It is written in **C#** using **Rider**, following an object-oriented structure with a `Program` class.

## Project Description

The game extends the classic *Rock–Paper–Scissors* with two extra shapes: **Spock** and **Lizard**.  
The goal is to reach a specified **winning score** before the computer (the agent) does.

The program:
- Lets the user choose between five shapes.  
- Lets the computer randomly choose a shape.  
- Determines who wins each round and updates the score.  
- Continues until one player reaches the **WinningScore** (default = 3).  
- Displays the final result and announces the winner.
